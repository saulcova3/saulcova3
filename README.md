## Hi there 👋

I'm Saúl and i like data. It helps me to gain knowledge by building stories, but what i mainly enjoy about its' ecosystem is that i can do the creepy math i'm unable to do anywhere else 😁.

About me:
- I mainly work in Python and SQL, with a little bit of Javascript 🐍
- I'm a huge fan of documenting and cleaning 🧹 
- I prefer black tea over coffee 🧋

## Working experience ⚙

My previous experiences on the STEM educational field as product/operations assistant intern gave experience at data processing and management. 

Daily i've found myself with these type of tasks:
  * Move data from one database to another 🔄
  * Fix bugs and solve tickets from other departments 🎫
  * Track the behaviour of different KPI's 📈
  * Create and deliver all sorts of reports 📊

I currently work as a *Data Integration Specialist* in EdTech projects, where I:
  * Perform data management and system configuration tasks across multiple platforms 🗃️
  * Resolve support cases and projects using Salesforce 🎫
  * Work with configuration scripts (YAML) 🛠️
  * Collaborate on the implementation of technological solutions for education 🤝

## My career interests are...

I'm heavily interested in contributing to education as i believe it's one of humanity's best tools for improvement, but i'm also a thermodynamics nerd, so i hope one day to be involved in renewable energy projects. And maybe researching! 📚
