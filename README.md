## Hi there 👋

I'm Saúl and i like data. It helps me to earn knowledge by building stories (and to do the creepy math i'm unable to do somewhere else 😁).

About me:
- I mainly work in Python and Javascript 🐍
- My favorite part of working on a project is the data cleaning and wrapping 🧹 
- I rather black tea over coffee 🧋

## Working experience ⚙

Rignt now i'm working at an STEM educational start-up as a product/operations assistant intern. I'm gaining experience at data processing and management. 

Daily i :
  * Move data from one database to another 🔄
  * Fix bugs and solve tickets from other departments 🎫
  * Track the behaviour of different KPI's 📈
  * Create and deliver different types of reports 📊

## I'm lookin to collaborate on...

Two fields where i'd like to build a career are the clean/renewable energies and social wellness. But i'm not restricted to them. I'm also into education and academical researching 📚
